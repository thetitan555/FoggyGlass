### JC-001 · 2026-07-02 · TKT-P0-01 · `FP` as a static-function class — ratified
**Decided.** `FP` is a `class_name FP extends RefCounted` with all-static
methods (`FP.mul(a, b)` etc.), carrying no instance state and never
instantiated.
**Serves.** TKT-P0-01 / AD-014 ("A small `FP` helper owns these ops"). AD-014
fixes the ops and convention; how the helper is *packaged* is left open.
**Alternatives passed over.** A global autoload singleton (adds a global for
pure math with no state — unnecessary coupling); free functions in a plain
script (GDScript has no module-level free functions callable as `FP.mul`).
**Why.** Static methods on a named class give the `FP.op()` call site the ops
want, with zero state, zero globals, and no instancing on the hot path. Purely
internal; invisible across the seam; trivially reversible.
**Ratified** (Architect, 2026-07-02). Pure packaging of the AD-014 helper, which
left "how the helper is packaged" open. No contract surface, no state, no seam
exposure — nothing to fold beyond noting the `FP.op()` call convention, which
AD-014 already implies. Folded into AD-014 (packaging + API line).

### JC-002 · 2026-07-02 · TKT-P0-01 · `to_int` truncates toward zero; `round_to_int` is the AD-014 rounding rule — ratified
**Decided.** Two distinct extractors: `to_int` truncates toward zero (drops the
fraction), `round_to_int` applies AD-014's rounding (round-to-nearest, ties away
from zero). Applied the *same* documented rounding rule to `mul` and `div`
results and the float bakes.
**Serves.** AD-014 ("a single documented rounding rule ... governs anywhere a
conversion rounds").
**Alternatives passed over.** A single extractor applying the rounding rule
(loses plain truncation, which callers sometimes want — e.g. whole-cell
indexing); arithmetic-shift truncation only (`>>` floors toward -inf for
negatives, which is neither truncation nor the AD-014 rule — a silent
inconsistency).
**Why.** AD-014 names the rounding rule for *conversions that round*; truncation
(fraction-drop) and rounding are different operations and callers need both
named distinctly. `mul`/`div`/bakes all round; `to_int` deliberately truncates,
symmetric about zero (`-1.9 -> -1`, matching `1.9 -> 1`), and is documented as
such. No values here that reach `step` are floats.
**Ratified** (Architect, 2026-07-02). This is a real contract elaboration, not
just latitude: AD-014 named one rounding rule for *conversions that round* but
was silent on plain truncation, which integer-cell callers (whole-cell indexing)
need. The two-extractor split is the correct resolution and is now binding on all
callers. Folded into AD-014 (extractors + which ops round). Note the ban on
arithmetic-shift truncation (`>>` floors toward -inf for negatives) is also now
part of the contract, so no caller silently reintroduces a third rounding
behavior.

### JC-003 · 2026-07-02 · TKT-P0-01 · 64-bit product overflow left unguarded, documented — ratified (behavior) + contract fixed in AD-014
**Decided.** `FP.mul` computes `a * b` at 64 bits before the `>> 16` shift and
does **not** guard/widen against intermediate overflow. Documented in the method
and here as a known bound.
**Serves.** AD-014 (`mul = (a*b) >> 16`). AD-014 specifies the op, not overflow
handling.
**Alternatives passed over.** 128-bit intermediate / split-multiply (correct at
any magnitude but slower and unjustified at slice magnitudes); saturating clamp
(hides a bug rather than surfacing it).
**Why.** At the slice's magnitudes (stage-bounded positions/velocities, box
dims) the product is far inside 64 bits, so the plain op is correct and cheapest.
Widening is out of TKT-P0-01 scope and, if the sim ever approaches the limit,
becomes an Architect contract question (what magnitudes must `FP` guarantee?) —
raise then, don't pre-solve now. Flagged as a bound so QA/Architect see it
consciously rather than discovering it.
**Ratified with a contract addition** (Architect, 2026-07-02). The Developer was
right to flag this: the *behavior* (plain 64-bit `(a*b)>>16`, no widening) is
ratified, but "what magnitude must `FP.mul` guarantee" is a contract I own, not a
dev latitude call, so it must not live only as a code comment. Folded into AD-014
as an explicit **operand-magnitude budget**: `FP.mul(a,b)` is correct while
`|a_units * b_units| < 2^31` (game-unit product), i.e. each operand safely up to
~46340 game units when the other is comparable. The slice's magnitudes
(stage-bounded positions/velocities/box dims, all far under ~10^3 units) sit
orders of magnitude inside this, so no guard is needed now. AD-014 now also
states the escalation trigger: if any sim value approaches the budget, widening
(128-bit / split-multiply) is an AD-014 revision, not a silent code change. This
keeps the bound in the owned contract where QA can assert against it, not buried
in a method doc.

### JC-004 · 2026-07-02 · TKT-P0-01 · Tick host advances against a minimal seam, not real `SimState`/`step` — ratified (01→03 ordering ruled intended)
**Decided.** `tick_host.gd` owns the fixed-tick clock discipline now (one tick
per `physics_process`, state-owned counter, `delta` never used to scale), but
advances an integer tick-only *stand-in* state through a single `_advance` seam,
because `SimState` and pure `step` are TKT-P0-03 and the input contract is 02.
**Serves.** TKT-P0-01 scope ("the fixed 60 Hz tick host ... advancing off a tick
counter in state") + the sequencing note that 01 lands before 02/03. The host's
job — pin the clock discipline — is landable before the state it will drive
exists.
**Alternatives passed over.** Deferring the whole host to 03 (would leave the
clock discipline unpinned while gameplay is written — exactly what the
sequencing note wants avoided: "violations are cheapest to catch as the sim is
written"); stubbing a fake `SimState` shape now (would pre-empt the 03 contract I
don't own — a contract invention, which is a flag, not latitude).
**Why.** The seam (`_sim_state` handle + single `_advance`) lets the
tick-authority logic be written and tested now and swapped to
`SimSim.step(state, in1, in2)` at 03 without changing the discipline. The
stand-in is deliberately a bare `int` (tick only) so it *cannot* accidentally
prefigure the real state shape. If 03's `step` signature or state handle differs
from what this seam assumes, that surfaces as a one-line swap here, not a
contract I baked in.
**Ratified; the 01→03 ordering is intended, not a decomposition defect**
(Architect, 2026-07-02). The seam call is exactly right and exactly what
build-for-extension (Tenet 3) wants. The sequencing the Developer surfaced is
deliberate: TKT-P0-01's job is to *pin the fixed-tick clock discipline* (one tick
per `physics_process`, state-owned counter, `delta` never scales), and that
discipline is landable and testable before the `SimState`/`step` contract it will
eventually drive exists. The roadmap principle "violations are cheapest to catch
as the sim is written" wants the clock authority pinned first, not last, so 01
correctly precedes 03. Advancing a bare `int` tick-only stand-in through a single
`_advance` seam — rather than stubbing a fake `SimState` shape — was the right
call; the fake-shape alternative would have pre-empted the 03 contract (correctly
identified as a flag, not latitude). At TKT-P0-03 the swap to
`step(state, in1, in2)` is a one-line change at `_advance` and must not touch the
clock discipline. Recorded as an explicit ticket note in p0-backbone.md so the 03
developer inherits the seam-swap expectation. **No defect to correct.**

### JC-005 · 2026-07-02 · TKT-P0-01 · Headless `SceneTree` test runners with exit-code gating — ratified
**Decided.** Tests are standalone `extends SceneTree` scripts run via
`godot --headless -s`, each printing an OK/FAIL summary and `quit(0/1)` so a
harness/CI gates on the exit code. No third-party test framework.
**Serves.** The Developer duty to write tests as I build (protocol), and QA's
need for deterministic, scriptable checks — kept framework-free so QA owns the
harness (TKT-P0-11) without inheriting a dependency.
**Alternatives passed over.** GUT/other GDScript test frameworks (a dependency
QA hasn't chosen and 11 may supersede); in-editor-only tests (not headless/CI-
gateable).
**Why.** `SceneTree` + exit code is the lightest thing that runs headless and
gates cleanly, and it leaves QA free to adopt or replace the harness at 11
without unpicking a framework. If QA standardizes on something at 11, these
convert trivially.
**Ratified** (Architect, 2026-07-02). Test-tooling latitude, not a contract:
framework-free, headless, exit-code-gateable, and deliberately leaves the harness
choice to QA at TKT-P0-11. Nothing to fold into a spec — the one consequence
worth flagging for QA is that these runners are provisional scaffolding QA may
supersede at 11, which the entry already states. QA owns the harness verdicts
(TKT-P0-11 scope), so this constrains nothing they inherit.
