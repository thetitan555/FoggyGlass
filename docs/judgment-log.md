# Judgment-Call Log

### JC-044 · 2026-07-08 · TKT-P1.1-01 (Part B, AD-035 render framing) — provisional

**Decision.** Implemented AD-035's render-only world→screen framing as a
`position`/`scale` transform applied directly to the `GeometryOverlay` Node2D
itself (`game/scenes/overlays/geometry_overlay.gd`), computed once at `_ready()`
against the current viewport size (and recomputed on `size_changed`), rather
than adding a `Camera2D` node. Three sub-calls bundled under one entry since
they're the same latitude the ticket/AD-035 both name as "placeholder, like
tuning":

1. **Mechanism: node transform, not `Camera2D`.** AD-035 explicitly names both
   as acceptable ("`a Camera2D` on the world layer, **or** an equivalent
   offset/zoom applied to the world-drawing node"). Chose the node transform
   because it is *structurally* scoped to `GeometryOverlay` alone — Godot
   applies a `Node2D`'s `position`/`scale` only to that node and its own
   children, never to siblings — so the three HUD `Control` panels (siblings
   of `GeometryOverlay` under `TrainingMode`, never its children) stay
   screen-anchored "for free," with no `CanvasLayer` restructuring and no
   dependence on Godot's `Camera2D.zoom` semantics (which invert between major
   engine versions and are easy to get backwards). **Passed over:** a
   `Camera2D` child on `GeometryOverlay` made `current` — equivalent in effect
   here, but would additionally require moving the three panels into a
   `CanvasLayer` (since a `Camera2D` transforms the whole viewport/canvas, not
   just its own node subtree) — more surface area for the same outcome.
2. **Exact numeric constants** (`WIDTH_FILL_FRACTION = 0.85`,
   `GROUND_LINE_FRACTION = 0.78`) are tuning placeholders exactly as AD-035
   invites ("exact zoom, screen anchor, and ground-line screen y are render
   feel, not contract"). Verified against `training_mode.tscn`'s actual panel
   extents (screen y up to 380) and both players' symmetric-start boxes
   (`test_geometry_overlay.gd`'s new framing tests) — comfortably clear with
   margin, not hand-waved.
3. **Stage bounds are fixed literals, not a live seam read.** `wall_left =
   -400`, `wall_right = 400`, `ground_y = 0` are hardcoded in
   `geometry_overlay.gd` (matching `StageState.new_initial()`'s actual
   defaults) rather than read from `SimState.stage` through a new
   `InspectionView` accessor. **Why:** the inspection surface currently
   exposes no stage-bounds view at all; adding one is a seam/contract shape
   change (`inspection-surface.md`) — out of this ticket's scope ("bounded to
   visible geometry... no new readouts") and arguably an Architect call, not a
   Developer latitude one, if it's ever wanted. The acceptance bar this ticket
   serves (AD-035) is specifically the *symmetric start positions*, which sit
   well inside these fixed bounds regardless. **Passed over:** extending
   `InspectionView` with a `stage()`/`StageView` read so the framing tracks a
   live (possibly non-default) stage — deferred; flagged below as a possible
   future seam extension, not done here.

**Scope note:** no new readout, no seam change — `GeometryOverlayModel.
build_draw_list` (the pure view-model QA goldens) is untouched; this is a
transform on the `Node2D` that renders that list, nothing else. Verified
render-only: `test_geometry_overlay.gd`'s
`_test_world_framing_is_render_only_no_effect_on_draw_list_or_state_hash`
applies the actual live node's framing and asserts both the `SimState` hash
and the draw list are byte-identical before/after.

**For Architect ratification:** whether stage bounds should later become a
live `InspectionView` read (would need a small seam addition) if a scene ever
runs a non-default stage; whether the node-transform mechanism (vs.
`Camera2D`) is the preferred convention for other future world-space overlays
this project adds (so a second overlay doesn't independently re-derive
framing, which AD-035's "Why" explicitly guards against).

### JC-045 · 2026-07-08 · TKT-P1.1-02 (control surface: bindings, dummy-mode-switch shape, legend) — provisional

**Decision.** Four bundled latitude calls completing `training-mode.md`'s
"Human control surface" section and criterion 13, all explicitly named
placeholder by the ticket ("Key/action choice is placeholder ... like tuning
numbers"):

1. **Key bindings.** Added eight `project.godot` input-map actions and bound
   them in `TrainingMode._unhandled_input`
   (`game/scenes/training_mode.gd`): `tm_pause`=P, `tm_step`=N,
   `tm_capture_reset`=C, `tm_do_reset`=R, `tm_dummy_mode_cycle`=M,
   `tm_button_0`=J, `tm_button_1`=K, `tm_button_2`=L. Movement stays on the
   existing built-in `ui_up/down/left/right` (arrow keys) — untouched, since
   `_sample_device_p1` already read them. Mnemonic where available (P-ause,
   N-ext, C-apture, R-eset, M-ode); attack buttons on J/K/L, adjacent keys
   clear of the control mnemonics, following the common arrows-plus-left-hand-
   buttons fightstick-emulation layout (arrows right hand, J/K/L or Z/X/C left
   hand — J/K/L chosen over Z/X/C only because it left Z/X/C/etc. free for any
   future binding without crowding one corner of the keyboard). **Passed
   over:** WASD for movement (would conflict with attack-button placement and
   isn't more discoverable than arrows, which the sampler already used).
2. **Dummy record/playback mode-switch is ONE cycling key, not three mode
   keys.** `tm_dummy_mode_cycle` advances P2's dummy
   PASSTHROUGH → RECORDING → PLAYBACK → PASSTHROUGH on each press
   (`TrainingMode._cycle_dummy_mode`), routed through the shell's own
   `get_dummy_mode`/`set_dummy_mode` (never `RecordPlaybackSource` directly).
   The ticket names this as one operation ("dummy record/playback
   mode-switch"), and a single reachable control satisfies "each operation is
   reachable from a bound control" without adding three new bindings for what
   the spec treats as one control. Fixed to P2 (index 1) — training-mode.md
   names P2 as "the dummy"; P1 stays the human's own passthrough source (still
   reachable via `set_dummy_mode(0, ...)` directly, just not bound to a key by
   this ticket). **Passed over:** three separate keys (one per mode) — more
   directly discoverable per-mode, but three new bindings for a single named
   operation, and not requested by the spec's wording.
3. **Frame-step is a direct, unconditional passthrough — no auto-pause.**
   `tm_step` always calls `step_once()` regardless of the shell's current
   pause state, exactly mirroring the existing `step_once()` method's own
   behavior (which likewise doesn't check `is_paused()`). The spec describes
   frame-step's *meaning* only "while paused"; a human is expected to press
   `tm_pause` first. **Passed over:** having the step binding also force
   `set_paused(true)` as a convenience — more forgiving UX, but it would be
   the binding *inventing* behavior beyond "call the corresponding control
   method," which is what this ticket scopes ("routed through the shell's
   control methods," not a new composite operation). If the human-inspection
   gate finds this awkward, worth a follow-up ticket, not a silent addition
   here.
4. **Controls legend reads Godot's InputMap directly, not hardcoded key
   text.** `game/scenes/controls_legend.gd` (`ControlsLegend`, mounted as a
   sibling `Control` in `training_mode.tscn`, top-right, `x:750..1136,
   y:16..260` — clear of the existing HUD panels at `x:16..700` and of the
   framed stage, which sits centered near screen x:454..698 for the symmetric
   start positions per `test_geometry_overlay.gd`) builds its text from
   `InputMap.action_get_events(action).as_text()` per action, so the legend
   can never drift out of sync with `project.godot`'s actual bindings if they
   change later. Not wired through `TrainingMode.set_source` / the
   `inspection_view()` seam at all — it has no sim dependency, so it isn't a
   "readout overlay" in `training-mode.md`'s taxonomy and needn't honor
   criterion 10's grep (there is nothing sim-internal in the file for it to
   catch). **Passed over:** a static hardcoded Label string — simpler, but
   would silently go stale the moment a key binding changes, defeating the
   "discoverable" intent criterion 13 asks for.

**Scope note:** no new readout, no seam change, no new control operation
beyond the five the spec names — this is binding + legend only. Determinism
unchanged: the device sampler's `_sample_device_p1` still emits one raw
`InputFrame` (same shape, three more bits read); `_unhandled_input` calls
existing control methods verbatim, never touching `TickHost`/
`TrainingHarness`/`RecordPlaybackSource` directly.

**For Architect ratification:** the specific key choices (P/N/C/R/M/J/K/L);
whether the dummy mode-switch should eventually get direct per-mode keys
instead of one cycling key; whether frame-step should auto-pause as a UX
convenience (a design call, not implementation, if wanted — flagged here
rather than added unilaterally).
