# Judgment-Call Log

> Owned by the **Developer** (appends entries); the **Architect** ratifies or
> overturns each at least once per feature, before audit (protocol cadence).
> Written for other roles to pick up: QA reads it for drift, the Architect to
> fold ratified calls into the spec, future work to inherit decisions instead of
> re-deriving them. Every entry is a *latitude* call — how to build something the
> spec already decided *what* it is. Anything touching a contract, feel, or tenet
> is a flag (`flags.md`), not an entry here.

> Status: **provisional** (recorded, awaiting ratification) · **ratified** ·
> **overturned**. Entries are append-only; supersede rather than rewrite.

### JC-001 · 2026-07-02 · TKT-P0-01 · `FP` as a static-function class — provisional
**Decided.** `FP` is a `class_name FP extends RefCounted` with all-static
methods (`FP.mul(a, b)` etc.), carrying no instance state and never
instantiated.
**Serves.** TKT-P0-01 / AD-014 ("A small `FP` helper owns these ops"). AD-014
fixes the ops and convention; how the helper is *packaged* is left open.
**Alternatives passed over.** A global autoload singleton (adds a global for
pure math with no state — unnecessary coupling); free functions in a plain
script (GDScript has no module-level free functions callable as `FP.mul`).
**Why.** Static methods on a named class give the `FP.op()` call site the ops
want, with zero state, zero globals, and no instancing on the hot path. Purely
internal; invisible across the seam; trivially reversible.

### JC-002 · 2026-07-02 · TKT-P0-01 · `to_int` truncates toward zero; `round_to_int` is the AD-014 rounding rule — provisional
**Decided.** Two distinct extractors: `to_int` truncates toward zero (drops the
fraction), `round_to_int` applies AD-014's rounding (round-to-nearest, ties away
from zero). Applied the *same* documented rounding rule to `mul` and `div`
results and the float bakes.
**Serves.** AD-014 ("a single documented rounding rule ... governs anywhere a
conversion rounds").
**Alternatives passed over.** A single extractor applying the rounding rule
(loses plain truncation, which callers sometimes want — e.g. whole-cell
indexing); arithmetic-shift truncation only (`>>` floors toward -inf for
negatives, which is neither truncation nor the AD-014 rule — a silent
inconsistency).
**Why.** AD-014 names the rounding rule for *conversions that round*; truncation
(fraction-drop) and rounding are different operations and callers need both
named distinctly. `mul`/`div`/bakes all round; `to_int` deliberately truncates,
symmetric about zero (`-1.9 -> -1`, matching `1.9 -> 1`), and is documented as
such. No values here that reach `step` are floats.

### JC-003 · 2026-07-02 · TKT-P0-01 · 64-bit product overflow left unguarded, documented — provisional
**Decided.** `FP.mul` computes `a * b` at 64 bits before the `>> 16` shift and
does **not** guard/widen against intermediate overflow. Documented in the method
and here as a known bound.
**Serves.** AD-014 (`mul = (a*b) >> 16`). AD-014 specifies the op, not overflow
handling.
**Alternatives passed over.** 128-bit intermediate / split-multiply (correct at
any magnitude but slower and unjustified at slice magnitudes); saturating clamp
(hides a bug rather than surfacing it).
**Why.** At the slice's magnitudes (stage-bounded positions/velocities, box
dims) the product is far inside 64 bits, so the plain op is correct and cheapest.
Widening is out of TKT-P0-01 scope and, if the sim ever approaches the limit,
becomes an Architect contract question (what magnitudes must `FP` guarantee?) —
raise then, don't pre-solve now. Flagged as a bound so QA/Architect see it
consciously rather than discovering it.

### JC-004 · 2026-07-02 · TKT-P0-01 · Tick host advances against a minimal seam, not real `SimState`/`step` — provisional
**Decided.** `tick_host.gd` owns the fixed-tick clock discipline now (one tick
per `physics_process`, state-owned counter, `delta` never used to scale), but
advances an integer tick-only *stand-in* state through a single `_advance` seam,
because `SimState` and pure `step` are TKT-P0-03 and the input contract is 02.
**Serves.** TKT-P0-01 scope ("the fixed 60 Hz tick host ... advancing off a tick
counter in state") + the sequencing note that 01 lands before 02/03. The host's
job — pin the clock discipline — is landable before the state it will drive
exists.
**Alternatives passed over.** Deferring the whole host to 03 (would leave the
clock discipline unpinned while gameplay is written — exactly what the
sequencing note wants avoided: "violations are cheapest to catch as the sim is
written"); stubbing a fake `SimState` shape now (would pre-empt the 03 contract I
don't own — a contract invention, which is a flag, not latitude).
**Why.** The seam (`_sim_state` handle + single `_advance`) lets the
tick-authority logic be written and tested now and swapped to
`SimSim.step(state, in1, in2)` at 03 without changing the discipline. The
stand-in is deliberately a bare `int` (tick only) so it *cannot* accidentally
prefigure the real state shape. If 03's `step` signature or state handle differs
from what this seam assumes, that surfaces as a one-line swap here, not a
contract I baked in.

### JC-005 · 2026-07-02 · TKT-P0-01 · Headless `SceneTree` test runners with exit-code gating — provisional
**Decided.** Tests are standalone `extends SceneTree` scripts run via
`godot --headless -s`, each printing an OK/FAIL summary and `quit(0/1)` so a
harness/CI gates on the exit code. No third-party test framework.
**Serves.** The Developer duty to write tests as I build (protocol), and QA's
need for deterministic, scriptable checks — kept framework-free so QA owns the
harness (TKT-P0-11) without inheriting a dependency.
**Alternatives passed over.** GUT/other GDScript test frameworks (a dependency
QA hasn't chosen and 11 may supersede); in-editor-only tests (not headless/CI-
gateable).
**Why.** `SceneTree` + exit code is the lightest thing that runs headless and
gates cleanly, and it leaves QA free to adopt or replace the harness at 11
without unpicking a framework. If QA standardizes on something at 11, these
convert trivially.
