### [resolved] 2026-06-27 · raised-by: Architect · owner: Strategist · re: /docs/protocol.md
Problem: the protocol says game code lives in the engine project tree, "path is
the Architect's call; recorded here once set." I've set it: **`/game`** at repo
root (recorded canonically in `/docs/spec/decisions.md`, AD-013). The protocol's
"Where things live" note should mirror this so the path is discoverable from the
protocol, not only the decision record. Low-stakes — a documentation mirror, not
a design change.
---
Resolution (Strategist): Agreed — fixed, not a design change. `/game` is the
Architect's call to make (the protocol explicitly leaves the engine path to
them). Mirrored `/game` into the protocol's "Where things live" prose and the
artifact table so the path is discoverable from the protocol, with AD-013 as the
canonical source. No further action.

### [resolved] 2026-06-27 · raised-by: Consultant (via user) · owner: Architect · re: combat-resolution.md (advantage, AD-008)
Problem: The canonical advantage (`defender_remaining_stun − attacker_remaining_recovery`) is computed per-tick but no reference frame is pinned, so there is no defined "the" on-hit/on-block number for content or UI to read; and `attacker_remaining_recovery` is taken from the current move-state's recovery, which is incorrect once cancels let the attacker become actionable early — making the surfaced advantage misleading in exactly the pressure/combo cases the legibility goal most depends on.
Context caveat: raised from chat; owner, confirm against live project state before acting.
---
Resolution (Architect): Confirmed against the spec and accepted — both gaps were
real. Fixed in `combat-resolution.md` (Advantage section) and AD-008: one formula
now surfaces two values — a **static** move frame-advantage pinned at first-active
contact, attacker uncancelled (the canonical number content/UI read), and a
**live** per-tick advantage where `attacker_remaining_recovery` = actual
frames-to-actionable *including committed cancels*, so the readout stays truthful
in pressure/combo cases. Acceptance criterion #3 updated to check both.

### [resolved] 2026-06-27 · raised-by: Consultant (via user) · owner: Architect · re: combat-resolution.md (AD-009/AD-010) + move-format.md (cancels)
Problem: The phase order and hitstop rule don't state whether the state-machine/cancel phase (phase 2) processes cancels while a character is frozen in hitstop, nor whether the one-frame path from hit-confirm (cancel_tags granted in phase 5) to cancel-availability (consumed in phase 2 next tick) is intentional. Both are unstated, feel-defining decisions. Relatedly, `cancels` is a single field carrying gatling/special/whiff/rehit semantics with no model spelled out.
Context caveat: raised from chat; owner, confirm against live project state before acting.
---
Resolution (Architect): Accepted. (1) Cancels during hitstop — a frozen character
may *buffer* a cancel but executes it only on the first unfrozen tick (AD-017 +
Hitstop section). (2) The grant→consume path is intentional: `cancel_tags` granted
phase 5 of tick T are usable from tick T+1, a uniform one-tick latency that falls
out of the fixed phase order (AD-009), now stated. (3) `cancels` is no longer one
opaque field — it's a typed `CancelRule` list (target / condition / window / input
/ requires_tag) in `move-format.md` (AD-015), with gatling/special/whiff expressed
as rules, not special cases. Rehit is split out of cancels (AD-016). Acceptance
criteria added (combat #8, move-format #7).

### [resolved] 2026-06-27 · raised-by: Consultant (via user) · owner: Architect · re: decisions.md AD-004 (+ simulation.md)
Problem: AD-004 permits in-place mutation of SimState and rejects copy-per-step as "needless allocation pressure," but at slice scale (single machine, 60Hz, two characters) that pressure is likely negligible, while mutability makes the purity contract enforceable only by discipline and leaves purity bugs detectable only when a golden/determinism test happens to hit the offending path — trading away the verifiability the slice exists to prove. Worth re-justifying mutability against this scale and Tenet 3.
Context caveat: raised from chat; owner, confirm against live project state before acting.
---
Resolution (Architect): Agreed — overturned. The verifiability argument is correct
and aligns with Tenets 1 & 3 (the slice exists to *prove* determinism). AD-004
revised and `simulation.md` updated: `step` must not mutate its input; it writes a
distinct output state (buffer reuse of non-live states allowed, so no per-tick
allocation churn). Purity is now a cheap standing assertion — `hash(prev)`
unchanged after `step`. Acceptance criterion #9 added.
---

### [resolved] 2026-06-27 · raised-by: Consultant (via user) · owner: Architect · re: move-format.md + combat-resolution.md (phase 5)
Problem: Hit resolution defines single-hit integrity via `id_group` but specifies no rehit model for intended multi-hit moves (cadenced or sequential hits) and no resolution path for throws (blockstun bypass, tech window, throw-vs-throw, air throw) beyond `throwboxes`/`invuln` existing — so the contract has no answer for two common move classes. Needs either a model or an explicit "deferred."
Context caveat: raised from chat; owner, confirm against live project state before acting.
---
Resolution (Architect): Accepted — both classes now have models (AD-016).
Multi-hit: sequential (distinct `id_group`s across keyframes) or cadenced
(`HitBox.rehit_interval`). Throws: throwbox connect bypasses blockstun, with a tech
window (defender throw input → tech to neutral; simultaneous throws clash to a
tech). Air throws and formal throw-vs-throw priority are **explicitly deferred** —
out of the slice's two grounded movesets — with throwbox / `invuln` /
air-eligibility fields left in place so they're later additions, not rewrites
(Tenet 3). Specced in `move-format.md` + `combat-resolution.md` (Throws / Multi-hit
sections); acceptance criteria added (combat #9–10, move-format #8).

### [resolved] 2026-06-27 · raised-by: Architect · owner: Strategist · re: /docs/roadmap.md (P1) + missing character-A brief
Problem: The roadmap scopes P1 as "first character + debug/technical training
mode," built *together* — the debug mode needs something to observe. But the only
P1 brief handed down is `debug-training-mode.md`; there is no brief for character A.
I've specced the training mode against the P0 test character, so the Developer is
**not blocked** (TKT-P1-01…09 can proceed). However, the training mode's value —
and acceptance criteria 5–9 (geometry, real frame data, advantage on real moves,
combo accounting) — only become meaningfully verifiable against a real moveset.
Without a character-A brief, "P1 done" can be demonstrated only against a trivial
test character, which under-proves the feature.
Ask (Strategist's call, not mine): do you intend character A as part of this same
P1 push (then it needs a brief — its archetype/moveset is the roadmap's own open
question), or as a separate phase the training mode formally precedes? Either is
fine for sequencing; I just need to know which so the spec/tickets reference the
right "done" bar. Not urgent for the Developer to *start*; it is needed before P1
can be *audited as done*.
---
Resolution (Strategist): Accepted — the inconsistency was real and mine. Ruling:
**character A is part of the P1 push, not a separate later phase.** The training
mode is the charter's legibility instrument; auditing it against a trivial test
character would stamp "done" on an unproven instrument, which is the one place I
won't accept a soft audit. Delivered the missing brief at
`/docs/briefs/character-a.md` (a grounded, simplified shoto — L/M/H buttons,
cr.MK, fireball, shoryuken, throw + basics; archetype confirmed with the user).
So the **P1 done-bar is the training mode validated against character A.** Per
your note, this does not block the Developer from starting against the P0 test
character (TKT-P1-01…09); character A must land before P1 is *audited* as done.
Two items routed to you in the brief's open questions: (1) the L/M/H three-button
layout is slice-wide — please reflect it in the input contract, not as
character-A-local; (2) all of A's frame data/properties are yours to spec within
the stated identity. Roadmap's character-A open question is now closed.

### [resolved] 2026-06-27 · raised-by: Consultant (via user) · owner: Architect · re: inspection-surface.md
Problem: The inspection surface exposes view-only float fields (`position_px`, `rect_px`) on the same returns that QA golden-snapshots (criterion 4) through the same surface QA reads (criterion 11). Per Tenet 1, floats behave differently across platforms/compilers; a golden file that includes `_px` fields risks platform-dependent mismatches, defeating the golden harness. Need a decision: goldens snapshot fixed-point truth only, with `_px` treated as a render-only projection excluded from snapshots (or an equivalent split of the surface's QA vs. render subsets).
Context caveat: raised from chat; owner, confirm against live project state before acting.
---
Resolution (Architect): Confirmed and accepted — real risk. Adopted exactly the
proposed split (AD-019): the snapshot-able surface carries **fixed-point truth
only**, no float fields. Removed `position_px`; `BoxView.rect_px` → `rect`
(fixed-point). Pixel coordinates are now a **render-only projection** (fixed→px)
computed for drawing and excluded from every golden/determinism snapshot — the UI
converts at draw time. Updated `inspection-surface.md` (principles, PlayerView,
BoxView, new "Render projection" section, criteria 4 & 6) and the training-mode
geometry overlay. One surface preserved (AD-011 intact); snapshots stay float-free.

### [resolved] 2026-06-27 · raised-by: Consultant (via user) · owner: Architect · re: training-mode.md
Problem: `do_reset()` restores `SimState` only, but the `RecordPlaybackSource` playback cursor lives outside `SimState` (Tenet 2: input sources are external to the sim). So resetting a situation does not re-sync the playback dummy to the reset point — a recorded sequence will not replay in sync with the rep, which breaks the core training-rep loop. The non-re-sync is forced by the seam, not chosen: the current structure cannot express a re-synced reset without explicit handling. No acceptance criterion covers reset+playback interaction (criteria 3 and 4 are tested independently). Define intended behavior (re-sync on reset as the default; independent/"metronome" playback as an explicit option only if wanted) and add coverage. May implicate Tenet 2 interpretation — re-route to the user if resolution needs a tenet change.
Context caveat: raised from chat; owner, confirm against live project state before acting.
---
Resolution (Architect): Confirmed and accepted. Intended behavior = **re-sync on
reset** (AD-020): the reset point captures both the sim `StateBlob` and each
`RecordPlaybackSource`'s playback position, and `do_reset()` restores both, so the
dummy replays in sync every rep. Independent/"metronome" playback is out of slice
scope. **No tenet change needed** — I checked: the coordination lives in the
training-mode harness, which sits above the sim and owns both the runner and the
sources, so the sim still knows nothing about input sources (Tenet 2 holds); the
frame-indexed `InputSource` contract makes the rewind natural. Updated
`training-mode.md` (reset section + new acceptance criterion 12), tickets
TKT-P1-03/04, and added AD-020. So this did **not** route to the user — the seam
already permits a re-synced reset once the reset point includes source position.

### [resolved] 2026-07-01 · raised-by: Strategist · owner: Architect · re: /docs/tickets/ (missing P0 decomposition)
Problem: The P0 backbone has spec but no ticket decomposition — `/docs/tickets/`
contains only P1. `spec/README.md` pointed the Developer at TKT-P1-01, but every
P1 ticket depends on P0 deliverables (sim loop, `SimState`, `InputSource`,
inspection-surface stub) that have no tickets to build them by. The Developer's
role prompt says "build per the tickets"; a memory-less Developer session either
stalls or invents its own decomposition. Ask: decompose P0 into tickets
(interfaces-first, per your own seam ordering) before the Developer's first
session — this is the current blocker for development starting at all.
---
Resolution (Architect, 2026-07-02): Done — `/docs/tickets/p0-backbone.md`
decomposes P0 into **TKT-P0-01…11**, interfaces-first: the input contract (02)
and the inspection-surface stub (04) land as real interfaces before the pipeline
that fills them; the done-bar scenario (10) lands as soon as core resolution (07)
does; throws/multi-hit (08–09) complete the spec after the tenet proof; the
determinism/serialization hooks (11) come online with the sim loop, not at the
end. `spec/README.md` now points the Developer at **TKT-P0-01** as the first work.

### [resolved] 2026-07-01 · raised-by: Strategist · owner: Architect · re: /docs/spec/character-a.md (BnB routes contradict the frame data)
Problem: Two internal contradictions, checkable by the spec's own link arithmetic
(the same arithmetic that correctly yields the 5H link: window = on-hit advantage
− startup + 1 → 7 − 5 + 1 = 3). (a) Route 3 (`2L , 2L , 2M > 236H`) is impossible
as written: `2L , 2L`, claimed as a 1-frame link, computes to a **0-frame window**
(+3 hit adv vs 4f startup), and `2L , 2M` computes to **−2** (+3 vs 6f). Either
the hitstun table or the route is wrong. (b) Route 5 (`5M (CH) , 2M > 623L`)
depends on counterhit bonus stun, but no counterhit system exists anywhere in
`combat-resolution.md` or `move-format.md`. Fix the data or the routes; if
whether CH belongs in the slice is a design/scope question rather than a spec
gap, kick that part back to me. Note QA impact: criterion 10 ("each required
link window is non-empty") fails this spec as written.
---
Resolution (Architect, 2026-07-02): (a) Data fixed: `2L` hitstun 12 → **15**
(on-hit +3 → +6), making route 3 arithmetic-valid — `2L , 2L` = 3f window,
`2L , 2M` = 1f (the kit's hardest link; the old "1f" claim was misattributed to
`2L , 2L`). (b) Ruled + kicked: correct, no counterhit system exists in the
slice's combat resolution, and I won't grow P0 scope on my own authority — route
5 is removed, replaced with a DP-punish route; whether CH *should* enter the
slice is yours and is raised as a new flag below (owner: Strategist). Criterion
10's link arithmetic now checks out for every route.

### [resolved] 2026-07-01 · raised-by: Strategist · owner: Architect · re: /docs/spec/character-a.md (tuning values baked into acceptance criteria)
Problem: Acceptance criteria pin tuning-grade numbers: criterion 3 requires the
5H→5M link window be "exactly 3 frames," and criterion 2 requires derived frame
data "equal the tables" while the DP on-block values are approximate ("≈ −34").
These numbers were authored with no playable sim to feel them in; once one
exists, every tuning pass becomes a criterion failure requiring a flag
round-trip. Ask: re-shape the criteria to pin **structure** (the link exists and
is displayed; advantage derives from the one formula; the DP is full-punishable)
and mark the numeric tables **provisional until playable**, so QA can pass a
tuning change that preserves structure. The exact criterion shape is yours; the
provisional-numbers stance is mine and the user's.
---
Resolution (Architect, 2026-07-02): Adopted. `character-a.md` gains a **Tuning
status** stance — all numeric tables provisional until playable; structure is
binding. Criteria 2, 3, 4, 6 re-shaped to pin structure: derivation-consistency
via the one formula (not exact table values); the `5H` link non-empty, tight, and
displayed (3f is an authored target, provisional); `2H` invuln covering its
active frames and at-worst-slightly-minus; the DP full-punishable **by
construction** (even 25f `5H` punishes) rather than "≈ −34". AD-022's 9f/6f
buffer windows stay pinned — those are system constants, not character tuning.
---

### [resolved] 2026-07-01 · raised-by: Strategist · owner: Architect · re: /docs/spec/character-a.md + /docs/spec/README.md (character B pre-committed in spec)
Problem: Both docs stated character B's identity (gatlings + jump cancels, "per
the peek ahead"), but B's archetype is a roadmap open question owned by the
Strategist and deferred to the P2 brief. Root cause: the user steered A's numbers
in chat "to match up to a B like that"; the direction never landed in an owned
artifact, so the Architect recorded its understanding in the only place it could
— its own spec.
---
Resolution (user directive; edits applied by Strategist on the user's
instruction): Direct B references removed from both docs — A's "no gatlings / no
jump cancels" stance is unchanged and now points at "a later contrast character";
the user's actual leaning is recorded where direction lives (`roadmap.md` → open
questions). The protocol gains a **"direction lives upstream"** working agreement
so chat steers get routed to the owning artifact instead of recorded downstream.
Bundled user-directed hygiene edits, also applied by the Strategist: "awaiting
review" removed from `spec/README.md` status (no such gate exists in the
protocol); a one-line AD index added atop `decisions.md`; resolved flags moved to
`flags-archive.md`. Architect: on your next session, sanity-check that nothing
else in the spec leans on B's specifics, and re-own the touched files.
*(Architect, 2026-07-02: sanity-check done — remaining "later contrast
character" mentions state only A's negative space, not B's identity; touched
files re-owned. Relay complete; ready for archive.)*

### [resolved] 2026-07-02 · raised-by: Architect · owner: Strategist · re: /docs/briefs/character-a.md (counterhit: in or out of the slice?)
Problem: A's spec briefly leaned on counterhit bonus stun (removed — no CH system
in `combat-resolution.md`; Architect declined to grow P0 scope on its own
authority). CH is a genre-standard reward-for-reads layer, mechanically cheap to
add later (one bonus-stun rule; the move format's fields already suffice), but it
is new system scope and an added legibility surface (a CH cue is one more thing
the player must read in the moment).
---
Resolution (Strategist, 2026-07-02): **CH stays out of the slice.** The vertical
slice exists to prove the architecture, not to add breadth — and CH buys no
architectural proof while adding scope and a read-in-the-moment cue that cuts
against the charter's legibility standard. The move format already supports
adding it cheaply post-slice, so deferring costs nothing now and forecloses
nothing later. Not a P1/P2 brief line; revisit post-slice if a character's
identity actually needs it. Spec's standing assumption (no CH anywhere in the
slice) is correct as-is. Relay complete; archived.

### [resolved] 2026-07-02 · raised-by: QA · owner: Strategist · re: /docs/tickets/p0-backbone.md + roadmap "done-when" (TKT-P0-01 audit scope)
Problem: TKT-P0-01's "Acceptance" line names crit 5 and crit 9 as its bar, but the
majority of what makes the ticket's tenet-proof meaningful (purity, round-trip,
determinism) is correctly deferred to 03/11. Raised only so done-tracking is
explicit that "P0-01 passed audit" means its own reachable bar passed, not that
the determinism tenet is proven end-to-end.
---
Resolution (Strategist, 2026-07-02): **Closed as intended — no wording change.**
The roadmap's "done-when" for the P0 tenet-proof already lands on TKT-P0-10 (green
done-bar) + TKT-P0-11 (harness hooks green), not on 01 in isolation; the partial
coverage QA notes is the intended shape of an interfaces-first sequence. Recording
the resolution here is enough to keep done-tracking honest; no roadmap edit
warranted. Relay complete; archived.

### [resolved] 2026-07-02 · raised-by: QA · owner: Developer · re: game/sim/tick_host.gd (stale `SimSim`/`SimStim` identifier in seam comment)
Problem: The seam comments in `tick_host.gd` (and the JC-004 log) named the future
call `SimSim.step(...)` / `SimStim.step(...)`; the class landing at TKT-P0-03 is
`SimState`/`step`. Cosmetic doc drift flagged so the 03 developer isn't misled.
---
Resolution (owner, Developer, 2026-07-02): Fixed while closing the TKT-P0-03 seam.
`tick_host.gd` `_advance` now calls the real `SimState.step(state, in_p1, in_p2)`
and the comment names it correctly; zero `SimSim`/`SimStim` references remain in
`game/`. JC-004 log entry left as append-only history per supersede-don't-rewrite.

### [resolved] 2026-07-02 · raised-by: QA · owner: Architect · re: /docs/spec/simulation.md + /docs/spec/input.md (produce-before-query ordering)
Problem: Specs required inputs be produced before the sim reads them (no future
reads) but didn't make the produce-before-query ordering an owned invariant or a
checkable acceptance criterion — in the scaffold it rested on Godot node tree
order (JC-009). Safe at runtime (sources + host assert against future reads) but
nothing for QA to statically verify the contract against. (F-001)
---
Resolution (Architect, 2026-07-02): FIXED. input.md now owns a "Produce-before-query
ordering (owned invariant)" clause — ordering owned by the *driver* (layer holding
sources + runner, per AD-020), not `step` and not the sources; sampling deliberately
NOT moved into the tick host (would couple it to concrete sources, breaking AD-002).
Added input.md acceptance criterion 7 so QA can assert it statically: (a) a source
faults on an unproduced-frame query; (b) the driver produces-then-advances. JC-009's
wiring-layer sampling ratified as one valid way to satisfy the invariant. Relay
complete; archived by Strategist.
